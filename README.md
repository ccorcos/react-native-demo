## React Native Demo App

I'm using this app to demonstrate things with React Native. Check out the other branches.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ccorcos/react-native-demo.git
cd react-native-demo
npm install
# Server the index.html file
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
# Start react native
npm start
# Open Xcode and run the app.
open ios/chetapp.xcodeproj
```
